CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a crucial aspect of front-end web development, as it is responsible for styling and laying out web pages. 
CSS is a vital skill for front-end developers because it enables them to create beautiful, functional, and accessible websites.
By mastering CSS, front-end developers can create rich and engaging user experiences that drive engagement and conversion.

In the following project, I have attempted to use the best practises of CSS and SCSS. 
From BEM model to 7-1 architecture, my journey in making this porject live has been of incredible learning.
This website is fully resposive and has support for various broswers as well.

Advance SCSS concepts like mixins, vairables and nesting has been used for reuability and readbility,

The Project has been divinded into 5 folders including base, abstract, components, layouts and pages. 

There are lots of more details to it and I know some of these concept might be really helpful for developer.
I'll be publishing a blog on it soon.

Until then, please check out the live website here :))
